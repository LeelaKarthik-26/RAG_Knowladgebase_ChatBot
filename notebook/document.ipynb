What should I do after completing the course? \\nA note from your instructor: \\nI really prefer the more math-heavy books. Especially after completing this course, they will help you \\nreinforce what you have learned and give you a better understanding of the mechanics of behind the \\nformulas and the techniques used. In my opinion, introductory statistics books will overlap a lot with \\nwhat we do in this course and will not prove that beneficial. \\nLight and fun: \\nAn interesting read that may greatly aid you with your understanding is: 'A Field Guide to Lies and \\nStatistics: A Neuroscientist on How to Make Sense of a Complex World' by Daniel Levitin. I found the \\nbook quite fun, while not technically heavy at all. It looks into different ways people misinterpret \\nstatistics (often on purpose). \\nIf you are comfortable with Math: \\nI'd suggest the: 'Probability and Statistical Inference' by Nitis Mukhopadhyay.

When do we assume our data is from a population, rather than a sample? \\nLet's say, for example, in a biomedical field when a scientist is doing research using animals - some \\nanimals are given treatment A, and some animals are given treatment B, the rest are not given any \\ntreatment (control group). Each treatment group has 10 animals, so we have 30 in total. \\nIn this scenario the population in question is all animals. \\nWhy? \\nBecause we want to find a cure for all animals, right? We don't want to find a cure for 30 of them. \\nThere's no point in doing that. \\n*** \\nWhat about these three groups?  \\nNow, we've got 3 samples, 10 each. In real life, by the way, we would usually draw a sample of 30 \\nand then randomly divide it in 3. By all means these two scenarios are the same, but nobody is going \\nto perform the sampling 3 times (10 animals each). \\nOnce this is done, we have 3 groups of animals. Ideally, we want each of these 3 samples to be: \\nrandom and representative. \\n*** \\nLet's explore another example. \\nImagine you are trying to cure all animals, and you've picked 10 dogs. \\nThat would be highly uninformative. \\nWhat about horses, pigs, cows, cats, elephants? Given the same treatment, elephants will definitely \\nreact in a different way than dogs.\"),\n",

They are not the population itself. \\n*** \\nWe are using samples for several important reasons: \\n1) Time efficiency -> it is much easier to draw a sample of 30 dogs, rather than ... all dogs (which is \\nalso impossible). \\n2) Monetary cost -> it is much cheaper to work with 30 dogs. Think about how many people must be \\ninvolved to test a treatment on 5000 dogs. Where are you going to do this? Who is going to feed \\nthem, take care of them, walk them, etc. \\n3) Safety -> what if treatment A kills 9 out of 10 dogs? We don't want this to happen to thousands of \\ndogs. That's why we tested the treatment on only a sample and not the whole population. \\n*** \\nLet's think about a case where it may have been the population. \\nImagine that there is a village which has an unknown disease which is killing the dogs there. We find \\nthat there are only 30 dogs that are contaminated. \\nWe take them away from the others, so they don't spread the virus and then we decide to find a cure. \\nWe proceed as you indicated in the question. \\nThis is the population of dogs that have this disease. \\nIf we take 10 dogs out of the 30, it would be a sample. \\nAll 3 samples taken together make up the population. \\n \\n2. Is a sample random if, and only if, it is representative? \\n \\nNo, the statement: 'A sample is random IF AND ONLY IF the sample is representative?' is not correct. \\nConsider this. Here are the spoken languages in the USA \\nEnglish 79.2% \\nSpanish 13.0% \\nOther Indo-European 3.7% \\nAsian and Pacific island 3.3% \\nOther 0.8% \\nIf I contact 20 of my friends -> 16 English speaking, 2 Spanish speaking, 1 Asian speaking, 1 'Other \\nIndo-European'. This is more or less a representative sample. However, it is definitely not random, \\nbecause all of those 20 people were my friends. Thus, “representative” does not imply “random”. \\nYou can claim that: a sample is not representative; therefore, it is not random.\"),\n",

See example with languages above. \\nIf a sample is not representative, it may be because of lack of knowledge on the person sampling it, \\ncausing it to be non-random, too (unintentionally). \\n \\n3. Does the weight of a person have a true 0? \\n \\nWhat is meant is 'weight' as a variable, not 'weight of a person'. Sorry about that. \\nAs you know the weight of nothingness is 0, so weight can be 0. \\nWeight of a person, should have the same properties as weight, right?  \\nThe fact that it is not achievable does not mean it is not a true zero. Unlike the temperature example \\nwhere 0 degrees Celsius is a deceiving 0. \\n \\n \\n4. What is my null hypothesis? \\nIn statistics, the null hypothesis is the statement we are trying to reject. We define it that way, so we \\ncan reject it with a statistical test.  \\nConventionally, we include the equality sign in the null hypothesis. \\n \\n5. How can I create a histogram in Microsoft Excel? \\n \\nFor a thorough walkthrough for creating a histogram refer to the course notes for Descriptive Statistics \\n(Section 10, Lecture 26 in the Course Content tab). \\n \\nFor your convenience here’s a link to that lecture: https://www.udemy.com/the-data-science-course-\\ncomplete-data-science-bootcamp/learn/v4/t/lecture/10764384 \\n \\n6. When do I use the one-tailed test instead of the two-tailed test? \\n \\nWe use the one-tailed test when the null-hypothesis is some inequality. In that case, only values on one \\nside of the null can reject it.  \\n \\nFor instance, if the null hypothesis states that “a” is greater than “b”, then we can only reject if “a - b” is \\nsignificantly lower than 0.  \\n \\nIf instead, our null stated the two are equal, then we would have an equation that looks like “a - b = 0”. \\nWe can reject this hypothesis if “a – b” is significantly greater or significantly lower than 0. In this case, \\nwe have two possible ways of rejecting the null (if it is significantly 1) lower or 2) higher than the \\nhypothesized value), which is why we need a “two-tailed” test. \\n \\n \\n7. I can’t get my head around Statistics – Practical Example: Inferential \\nStatistics. \\n \\nTo make this as easy to follow as possible, we are going to examine one of the exercises from the \\ncourse. Go to the exercises available in Section 14, Lecture 74 and examine task number 3: \\nhttps://www.udemy.com/the-data-science-course-complete-data-science-\\nbootcamp/learn/v4/t/lecture/10764532\"),\n",

In any case, it is positive. If the average apple prices in NY MINUS the average apple prices in \\nLA is positive, then the apples in NY are more expensive. \\nUsing the same logic, we construct the confidence intervals in the practical example.  \\n1. If the confidence interval for the difference is strictly positive, then the first shop is outperforming \\nthe second. \\n2. If the confidence interval for the difference is strictly negative, then the second shop is \\noutperforming the first. \\n3. If the confidence interval for the difference is from negative to positive (e.g. (-0.5, 0.5)), then we are \\nnot sure if one shop outperforms the other, so we cannot make a statement based on confidence \\nintervals. \\n \\n \\n8. Why is the Central Limit Theorem important? \\n \\nThe main takeaway from the CLT is that no matter the underlying distribution, we know that the \\ndistribution of the sample means is normal (given a big enough sample). \\nThis means that we can take 1 sample (a SINGLE ONE!) and say: \\nImagine it was taken from the sampling distribution of the sample mean. It is normally distributed for \\nsure, right? Because of the CLT. \\nSo, when we are testing, we can use this insight and treat the sample mean as if it is coming from a \\nnormal distribution (because it is -> the sampling distribution of sample means). And since all our \\nhypothesis tests depend on normality, this proves extremely useful. \\n \\n9. How do I manually compute the P-value for T-statistics? \\nUnlike Z-scores, with T-statistics, we do not have a singular table of values, which matches T-scores \\nwith their associated P-values.  \\nThis comes from the fact that every T-statistic requires an associated degree of freedom. This means \\nthat if we want to have an associated P-value for any T-score with any degree of freedom, we would \\nrequire a 3-dimentional “table”. \\nFor a detailed discussion on the topic, please check this question: https://www.udemy.com/the-data-\\nscience-course-complete-data-science-bootcamp/learn/v4/questions/4896738 \\nThus, convention dictates that we have a single table, which includes numerous degrees of freedom, \\nbut only has data regarding the most commonly used P-values.  \\nIn short, the information you are looking for is NOT in the t-table, because it was intentionally cut out.  \\n \\n10.

When a model is non-significant, is it wrong? \\nA model that is non-significant is a model that has no explanatory power whatsoever. \\nFor instance, say you are wondering if it is going to rain tomorrow or it is going to be sunny. There are \\nways to predict that and weather forecasting agencies are using them. \\nNow, I tell you: here's my model... I flip a coin.

However, we recommend that you use the absolute path of a file when \\nloading the data.  \\n  \\nThus, you can write: \\n  \\ndata = pd.read_csv(‘ABSOLUTE_PATH/real_esate_price_size.csv’) \\n  \\nTo me this looks like: \\n  \\ndata = pd.read_csv('C:/Users/365/Desktop/The Data Science Course 2018 – All \\nResources/Part_4_Advanced_Statistical_Methods_(Machine_Learning)/S27_L142/real_estate_price\\n_size.csv') \\n  \\nIn your case, you can find that by opening the folder containing the files and copy-pasting the path.  \\n  \\nOnce you copy-paste this path, you should CHANGE ALL SLASHES from backward to forward. This \\nmeans that if your path is C:\\\\Users\\\\YOUR_COMPUTER_NAME\\\\Desktop\\\\... , you should make it look \\nlike: C:/Users/YOUR_COMPUTER_NAME/Desktop/… \\n  \\nNote that, due to the standards for referencing paths, in Python, instead of a backward slash ( \\\\ ), \\nyou should use a forward slash ( / ). \\n \\n \\n13.

Modify the loss function:\\n• L2 Regularization: Prevents the weights from getting too large (defined by L2 norm). Larger\\nthe weights, more complex the model is, more chances of overfitting.\\n• L1 Regularization: Prevents the weights from getting too large (defined by L1 norm). Larger\\nthe weights, more complex the model is, more chances of overfitting. L1 regularization\\nintroduces sparsity in the weights. It forces more weights to be zero, than reducing the the\\naverage magnitude of all weights\\n• Entropy: Used for the models that output probability. Forces the probability distribution\\ntowards uniform distribution.\\n2. Modify data sampling:\\n• Data augmentation: Create more data from available data by randomly cropping, dilating,\\nrotating, adding small amount of noise etc.\\n• K-fold Cross-validation: Divide the data into k groups. Train on (k-1) groups and test on 1\\ngroup. Try all k possible combinations.\\n3. Change training approach:\\n• Injecting noise: Add random noise to the weights when they are being learned. It pushes the\\nmodel to be relatively insensitive to small variations in the weights, hence regularization\\n• Dropout: Generally used for neural networks. Connections between consecutive layers are\\nrandomly dropped based on a dropout-ratio and the remaining network is trained in the\\ncurrent iteration. In the next iteration, another set of random connections are dropped.\\nWhat is Regularization in ML?\\n• Regularization is an approach to address over-fitting in ML.\\n• Overfitted model fails to generalize estimations on test data\\n• When the underlying model to be learned is low bias/high\\nvariance, or when we have small amount of data, the\\nestimated model is prone to over-fitting.\\n• Regularization reduces the variance of the model\\nUnder-fitting\\nOver-fitting\\nJust\\u2029Right\\nPreferred\\u2029if\\u2029size\\u2029\\nof\\u2029dataset\\u2029is\\u2029small\\nPreferred\\u2029if\\u2029size\\u2029\\nof\\u2029dataset\\u2029is\\u2029large\\n5-fold cross-validation\\nTest\\nTrain\\nTest\\nTest\\nTest\\nTest\\nTrain\\nTrain\\nTrain\\nTrain\\nTrain\\nTrain\\nTrain\\nConnections = 16\\nActive = 11 (70%) \\nDropout-ratio = 30%\\nActive = 11 (70%)\\nOriginal Network\\nFigure 2.

The datapoints wrongly classified with previous weak model is provided more weights to that they can\\nbe classified by the next weak leaner properly. In the test phase, each model is evaluated and based on the test error of\\neach weak model, the prediction is weighted for voting. Boosting methods decreases the bias of the prediction.\\n3.Stacking: Trains N different weak models (usually of different types – heterogenous) with one of the two subsets of the\\ndataset in parallel.
